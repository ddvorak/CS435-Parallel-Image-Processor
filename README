A program that manipulates images using the imagemagick++ library and demonstrates parallelization using OpenMP and will be ran on the LittleFe supercomputer/cluster system.  This is a project for Humboldt State University's Software Engineering Class.

Feel free to poke around with the code as much as you like!
